## Quick Setup

Install package

Add `django_global_places` app to INSTALLED_APPS in your django settings.py:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    'django_global_places'
    'rest_framework', # required only if using the provided REST endpoints
     ...,
)

from django_global_places.urls import router as django_global_places_router
your_router.registry.extend(django_global_places_router.registry)
```
    

### Explanation


This library handles the configuration and creation of `Countries`, `States`, and `Cities`.

After installation, you need to specify three parameters in your `settings.py` file:

-   `INCLUDE_LOCATION`: Enables the creation of the models.
-   `LOCATION_SCOPE`: Determines the scope of models required ('countries', 'states', or 'cities').
-   `INCLUDE_EXPANDED_COUNTRY`: Incorporates additional fields into the Country model.

Example:

    GLOBAL_PLACES = {
	    "INCLUDE_LOCATION": True,
	    "LOCATION_SCOPE": "state",
	    "INCLUDE_EXPANDED_COUNTRY": False,
    }


Once these variables are configured, your next steps are to run `makemigrations` and `migrate`.

To **populate** the newly created models, you should execute a Django command. This command will create all the necessary objects and update them if they already exist.

    python manage.py populate_global_places

### Rest endpoints

Three viewsets are included, one for each model: `Country`, `State`, and `City`. Each viewset features:

A list view displaying a summary of the objects.
A detail view presenting comprehensive information about each object.

- CountryViewSet:
	- url: global-places/countries
	- search fields: `name` and `iso3`
	- ordering fields: `id`, `name` and `iso3`

- StateViewSet:
	- url: global-places/states
	- search fields: `name` and `state_code`
	- ordering fields: `id`, `name` and `state_code`
	- filtering fields: `country`

- CityViewSet:
	- url: global-places/cities
	- search fields: `name`
	- ordering fields: `id` and `name`
	- filtering fields: `state`, `state__country`
